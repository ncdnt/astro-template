# Astro Starter Kit

```sh
pnpm create astro@latest -- --template ncdnt/astro-template
```

Basic Astro 5 project template with TS, ESLint, and Prettier set up out-of-the-box.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

The project structure is similar to that of a default minimal Astro project, but
with the extra ESLint and Prettier config files.

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page
is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |

| `pnpm build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`         | Preview your build locally                       |
| `pnpm astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
